# ClickTask - 90 Minute Project

## About the program

ClickTask is a program that serves as a very basic task manager. It allows functions such as adding tasks, deleting tasks,
editing tasks, completing / incompleting tasks, etc. The program stores tasks in a JSON format in a file in the same directory
called 'tasks.json'.

## About the development

ClickTask was meant to be a fun challenge to see if I could code something like this in under 90 minutes. I was able to accomplish
this. This time constraint explains the sloppiness and input cleansing oversights.

## What needs improved?

Eventually, I will finish and polish this code and upload it to a separate GitHub repo. It still needs comments and notation, heavier
input validation, cleaner input handling, and overall structural changes.

## Tools used in development

I used Python v3.10 and the 'json' library. The code was written in Visual Studio Code v1.90.2.
